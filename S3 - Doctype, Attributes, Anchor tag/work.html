        The stock market is a complex yet fascinating system that plays a crucial role in the global economy. It serves
        as a platform where shares of publicly traded companies are bought and sold, allowing businesses to raise
        capital while giving investors an opportunity to earn returns on their investments. To understand how the stock
        market works, we need to explore its components, mechanics, and impact on the economy. When you buy a share of
        stock, you are essentially purchasing a small ownership stake in a company. Companies issue shares to raise
        funds for various purposes, such as expanding operations, developing new products, or paying off debt. There are
        two main types of stock: common stock and preferred stock. Common stock typically comes with voting rights and
        the potential for dividends, while preferred stock generally does not carry voting rights but offers fixed
        dividends. The stock market is organized into various exchanges, the most notable being the New York Stock
        Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq. These exchanges provide a regulated environment for buying and selling stocks.
        Companies must meet specific criteria to be listed on an exchange, including financial transparency and
        regulatory compliance. When a company goes public for the first time, it conducts an Initial Public Offering
        (IPO), allowing investors to purchase shares at a set price. Trading on the stock market occurs through brokers
        and online trading platforms. Investors can place buy or sell orders for stocks, which are executed based on the
        current market price. The stock price is determined by supply and demand; when more people want to buy a stock
        than sell it, the price goes up, and vice versa. This dynamic nature of stock prices reflects the collective
        sentiment of investors regarding a company’s future performance.

    <h1>Pricing of Shares in the Stock Market</h1>
    <p>So at it’s most basic, a stock price is just the market value of a company spread across all the shares
        outstanding. Stocks are an ownership of the company so it’s whatever investors are willing to pay spread across
        how many investor shares there are. We see here the market capitalization, that’s the value investors are
        willing to pay for the company, is about $1.31 trillion. Now we can find how many shares, or pieces of
        ownership, in the statistics tab on Yahoo Finance or on just about any investing platform. We know that Apple
        has about 4.33 billion shares available; so that $1.31 trillion company value divided by 4.33 billion gives us
        the share price around $302 per share.</p>

        alt="Let’s look at an example here with Apple, ticker AAPl." />
    <p>What’s interesting here is that you realize, stock price has very little
        to do with whether it’s a good investment or not. A lot of investors will look for stocks under $5 a share
        thinking it’s a bargain-basement deal. Or they’ll think a high stock price means it’s a strong company. For
        example, regional bank Mars Bancorp, has a $340 share price which seems really strong, right? But the shares are
        down more than 12% this year and the company is really only valued at $27 million. The high share price is only
        because it has less than 100,000 shares issued. By comparison, look at Zynga, ticker ZNGA, with a price of under
        $8 per share. It’s jumped 34% over the last year and is valued at $7.6 billion. The reason the stock price is so
        low is simply a matter of almost a billion shares issued.</p>
