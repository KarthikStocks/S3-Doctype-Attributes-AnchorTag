    <p>The stock market is a dynamic and essential part of the financial world, where investors buy and sell ownership
        in public companies in the form of stocks. Understanding its workings can help investors navigate its
        complexities and potentially grow their wealth over time. Below is a detailed overview of the stock market, from
        its core concepts to strategies used by traders and investors. The stock market refers to the collection of
        markets and exchanges where the trading of stocks (shares of ownership in a company) takes place. These
        exchanges can be physical locations or electronic trading platforms. Major stock exchanges include the National
        Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in the India, along with several others globally, such as
        the London Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Stocks represent a fraction of
        ownership in a
        company, meaning when you buy a stock, you own a small piece of that company. Companies sell stocks to raise
        money for expansion, development, or other financial needs. Once the stock is available to the public through an
        Initial Public Offering (IPO), it can be bought and sold on the stock exchange by investors. The price of a
        stock is influenced by various factors, including the companyâ€™s performance, investor sentiment, and overall
        market conditions.</p>
